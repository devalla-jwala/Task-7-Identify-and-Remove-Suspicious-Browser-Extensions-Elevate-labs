Browser security, extensions, permissions, malware, security best practices.

This task is part of my cybersecurity internship. It focuses on browser security awareness by identifying and removing potentially harmful browser extensions.

---

##  Objective

- Learn to identify suspicious or malicious browser extensions  
- Understand how malicious extensions can harm users  
- Improve browser performance and privacy by removing unused or suspicious extensions

---

##  Tools Used

- Mozilla Firefox (similar steps for Chrome)  
- Built-in Extension/Add-on Manager  
- Firefox Add-ons review page  
- Manual analysis of permissions and developer info  

---

##  Steps Followed

###  Step 1: Open Browser Extension Manager (Firefox)

1. Open the **Mozilla Firefox** browser.  
2. Click on the **three horizontal lines (☰)** at the top-right corner.  
3. Click on **"Add-ons and themes"** → Select **"Extensions"**  
   OR  
   Type the following into the address bar and press Enter:
### Step 2: Review All Installed Extensions
- Carefully checked **every** installed extension.  
- Verified whether **I personally installed** it and if it’s **still in active use**.  
- **Flagged** any extensions that were:  
  - **Unused**  
  - **Unrecognized**  
  - **Seemed suspicious**  
  - **Bundled** silently with other software  



###  Step 3: Check Extension Permissions and Reviews
- Clicked **“Details”** on each flagged extension.  
- Checked the **permissions** requested (e.g., full access to site data).  
- Verified:  
  - If it was from a **trusted developer**  
  - Its presence and rating on the **Chrome Web Store / Firefox Add‑ons** page  
  - **User reviews** for warnings or complaints  

 **Red flags I looked for**
- Excessive permissions such as:  
  - “**Read and change all your data on all websites**”  
  - “**Manage your downloads**”  
- **Low rating** or fake‑looking reviews  
- **No developer info** or links to shady websites  

---

###  Step 4: Remove Suspicious or Unused Extensions
- Clicked the **“Remove”** button next to each suspicious extension.  
- **Confirmed** the removal when prompted.  

**Extensions I removed**

###  Step 5: Restart the Browser
1. **Closed** the browser completely.  
2. **Reopened** it after a few seconds.  
3. **Checked** whether:  
   - Pages load **faster**  
   - **Ads or pop‑ups** are gone  
   - The **extensions bar** is clean  

**Result:** Noticeable improvement in speed and no annoying toolbars or pop‑ups.

---

###  Step 6: Researched How Malicious Extensions Harm Users
I researched how dangerous extensions can impact users. Here's what I learned:

| Threat | Impact |
| --- | --- |
|  Spy on browsing activity | Collect history & visited URLs |
|  Steal login credentials | Capture passwords & session cookies |
|  Inject ads / malware | Alter pages, insert malicious scripts |
|  Slow browser performance | Consume CPU/RAM invisibly |
|  Hide in background | Persist without obvious UI indicators |

**Conclusion:** Regular auditing of extensions is critical to maintain privacy and security.

##  Deliverables

###  Suspicious Extensions Removed
| Extension Name | Reason for Removal |
| -------------- | ------------------ |
| Free VPN Super Extension | Too many permissions, unknown source |
| Shopping Deal Finder     | Auto‑installed, not in use         |

---

##  Outcome
- **Browser performance** significantly improved.  
- **All unknown / unused extensions** removed.  
- Increased **awareness** of browser hygiene and extension security best practices.
